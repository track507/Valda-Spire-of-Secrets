    ! Important
    *   - This script is still currently being written and is not yet complete.
    *   - I am updating this to fit the 13.2.0 version of MPMB's Character Sheet.
    *   - I will be referncing both Seaworld's version and u/Anasurimborlnnrilatas's scripts to save on time 
    
    ! NOTE
    *   - This script adds everything according to version 1.4 of Valda's Spire of Secrets
    *   - The previous script written by u/Anasurimborlnnrilatas found here https://pastebin.com/GwU8JnCM are from 2 years ago. (version unknown, but most likely 1.0)
    *   - Seaworld also made changes to the script to fix some issues with firearms
    *   - The reason for using ! and * etc is due to a VS Code extension that is used for comments
    
    TODO 
    *   - Basically everything currently since I still have school/work priorities
