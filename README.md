# Valda-Spire-of-Secrets

## Info
This script adds **ALL** of the content found in Valda's Spire of Secrets.

However, it is still currently in progress and in very early stages.
There are 10 new classes and over 150+ subclasses along with magic items, spells, etc. that need to be updated.
I say updated because the original script written by u/Anasurimborlnnrilatas found [here](https://pastebin.com/GwU8JnCM) is from 2 years ago for version 1.0 of the PDF.
Seaworld on Discord also made minor firearm fixes found [here](https://pastebin.com/GwU8JnCM)

The latest version of the PDF is 1.4 and was published 12/30/2022 (3 months after u/Anasurimborlnnrilatas made the script)
For the most part, most of version 1.4 is the same, but it has minor fixes and reworks that are different from the original 1.0.
Recent contributions from Seaworld and I have been adding both classes and subclasses from VSoS to MPMB's Character sheet. 
I am also going to go through the process of adding each class/subclass and ensuring that it's v13.2.0 compatible

I am going page by page and adding/updating content. I will be providing updates through the README.md 

## Important
  - **THIS ONLY ADDS THE CONTENT FROM VALDA'S SPIRE OF SECRETS V1.4, NOT THE "COMPLETE" VERSIONS OF MAGE HAND PRESS' BOOKS**
    - This is because Valda does not include all of a class's guide, and doesn't include some of the content from the complete class' books.
    - I will make separate scripts for the separate scripts for the complete class guide's after I'm finished with Valda's
  - Due to the "witch" being considered part of the sorcerer `regExpSearch`, I've overwritten the regEx to only include sorcerer so that the witch class can be properly added.
  - I've also overwritten the tempest domain cleric `regExpSearch` so that the destruction domain cleric can be added
  - Due to specific wording for the Investigator archivist subclass "witness" is specifically included(whatever that may mean)

Everything in this script has been updated to v13.2.1 for MPMB's Sheet and 1.4 of the PDF.
